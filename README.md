The GoURMET Translation API has been built as part of the [GoURMET
Project](https://gourmet-project.eu/). Its purpose is to provide a single
platform where all translation models produced as part of the GoURMET project
can be hosted, run and accessed rather than forcing the user of the translation
technology to need to integrate the translation models into the project
directly. This allows a single point for maintenance and upgrades to the
translation models.
