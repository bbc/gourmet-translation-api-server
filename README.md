# GoURMET Translation API

The GoURMET Translation API has been build as part of the [GoURMET Project](https://gourmet-project.eu/). It's purpose to to provide a single platform where all translation models produced as part of the GoURMET project can be hosted, run and accessed rather than forcing the user of the translation technology to need to integrate the translation models into the project directly. This allows a single point for maintenance and upgrades to the translation models.
